E-learning web platform

SIMPLE LEARN is a web platform built to simplify the teaching process and lighten the management team's workload, which frequently entails manual data entry and upkeep of conventional storage systems like files and records. By putting this framework into practice, educational institutions can use technology to reach a wider audience outside of traditional classroom settings and promote better collaboration, engagement, and instruction. The ELMS will provide a centralized platform where students can access course materials, participate in interactive learning activities, communicate with instructors and peers, and track their academic progress. The system will also offer administrative functionalities, such as course management, student enrollment, grading, and reporting, enabling educators and administrators to efficiently manage the educational ecosystem.
